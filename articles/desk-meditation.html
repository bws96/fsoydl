                <p>Deadlines are looming, Slack is pinging incessantly, and you feel your shoulders creeping up to your ears. We've all been there. The beauty of remote work is flexibility, but the downside is the blurring of lines between rest and grind. You don't need a yoga studio to find calm; all you need is your chair and 5 minutes.</p>

                <h2>Why Desk Meditation?</h2>
                <p>Micro-breaks are proven to reset your attention span. Even a few minutes of controlled breathing can lower cortisol levels (stress hormone) and increase alpha brain waves associated with relaxation.</p>

                <h2>Step-by-Step Guide</h2>

                <h3>1. The Setup (1 Minute)</h3>
                <p>Turn off your monitor or simply close your eyes to block out the blue light. Place your feet flat on the floor to ground yourself. Rest your hands comfortably on your thighs. Sit up straight, imagining a golden string pulling the top of your head toward the ceiling, elongating your spine.</p>

                <h3>2. The Breath (3 Minutes)</h3>
                <p>We'll use the <strong>4-4-6 Box Breathing</strong> technique:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inhale</strong> deeply through your nose for a count of <strong>4</strong>. Feel your belly expand like a balloon.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hold</strong> that breath for a count of <strong>4</strong>. Find stillness in the pause.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exhale</strong> slowly through your mouth for a count of <strong>6</strong>, releasing all tension.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Repeat this cycle for 3 minutes.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>💡 Pro Tip:</strong><br>
                    If your mind wanders to your to-do list (and it will), gently acknowledge the thought like a passing cloud and bring your focus back to the counting.
                </div>

                <h3>3. The Return (1 Minute)</h3>
                <p>Slowly wiggle your fingers and toes to wake up your body. Open your eyes. Notice how the room looks a bit brighter and clearer? You've just hit the reset button on your brain. You are now ready to tackle the next task with renewed clarity.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>💡 Consistency is Key:</strong><br>
                    Try to do this once every 2 hours. Set a recurring alarm on your phone titled "Breathe".
