# Project Blueprint

## Overview
Flow State is a resource hub for digital nomads and creators, featuring AI tools, tech fixes, and wellness tips. It is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## History
- **Initial Setup:** Basic project structure with `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, and content pages.
- **Footer Improvement:** Increased spacing between footer links using flexbox and added subtle vertical separators for better readability.

## Current Plan
1.  **Favicon:** Add a `favicon.svg` to brand the site.
2.  **Navigation:** Make the "Flow State" logo in the header clickable, redirecting to the homepage.
3.  **Visual Design:** Enhance the main page visuals by replacing the flat single-color background with a subtle gradient or pattern to reduce monotony.
4.  **Deployment:** Synchronize latest changes with the GitHub repository.
