# Project Blueprint

## Overview
Flow State is a resource hub for digital nomads and creators, featuring AI tools, tech fixes, and wellness tips. It is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## History
- **Initial Setup:** Basic project structure with `index.html`, `style.css`, `main.js`, and content pages.
- **Footer Improvement:** Increased spacing between footer links using flexbox and added subtle vertical separators for better readability.

## Current Plan
1.  **Favicon:** Add a `favicon.svg` to brand the site.
    redirecting to the homepage.
3.  **Visual Design:** Enhance the main page visuals by replacing the flat single-color background with a subtle gradient or pattern to reduce monotony.
4.  **Content Expansion:** Transform the `articles/invideo-ai.html` review into a comprehensive "Ultimate Guide," adding detailed feature breakdowns, pricing tables, a step-by-step workflow, and an FAQ section to increase perceived value.
5.  **Link Update:** Update all affiliate links to the new tracking URL `https://invideo.sjv.io/YRW9ze`.
6.  **Conversion Optimization:** Add a second strategic CTA button within the InVideo AI article to improve click-through rates.
7.  **Deployment:** Synchronize latest changes with the GitHub repository.
