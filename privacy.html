        <div class="content">
            <p>At Flow State, accessible from <strong>https://fsoydl.pages.dev</strong>, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Flow State and how we use it.</p>
    
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We collect information in the following ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Voluntarily Provided Information:</strong> When you use our Feedback Widget, you may choose to sign in via Google. We collect your <strong>email address, name, and profile picture</strong> provided by Google's authentication service. We also collect the content of the messages you send us.</li>
                <li><strong>Log Files:</strong> Like many other websites, we use log files. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, and referring/exit pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use cookies to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use the information we collect in various ways, including to:</p>

                <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our website.</li>
                <li><strong>Communicate with you:</strong> We use the email address provided via the Feedback Widget to respond to your inquiries, feedback, or support requests.</li>
                <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> We use Google Firebase Authentication to verify your identity when you submit feedback, preventing spam and abuse.</li>
                <li>Find and prevent fraud.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Third-Party Services & Data Processors</h2>
            <p>We use trusted third-party services to operate our site. These services have their own privacy policies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google Firebase:</strong> We use Firebase Authentication to handle user sign-ins securely. Your login credentials are processed by Google and are never stored on our servers. (<a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>FormSubmit:</strong> We use FormSubmit.co to transmit your feedback messages to our email inbox. The content of your message passes through their secure servers. (<a href="https://formsubmit.co/privacy" target="_blank">FormSubmit Privacy Policy</a>)</li>
                <li><strong>Google Analytics:</strong> We use Google Analytics to analyze website traffic and user behavior. This tool collects anonymous data such as page views, session duration, and geographic location to help us improve user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
            <p>We use cookies to enhance your experience. These include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> Necessary for the website to function (e.g., remembering your cookie consent preference).</li>
                <li><strong>Analytics Cookies:</strong> Used by Google Analytics to understand how visitors interact with the website.</li>
                <li><strong>Advertising Cookies:</strong> Used by Google AdSense and affiliate partners to deliver relevant advertisements.</li>

            <h2>5. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Flow State is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. We also participate in other affiliate programs (e.g., Writesonic, InVideo).</p>
            <p>This means if you click on a link and purchase an item, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.</p>

            <h2>6. Children's Information</h2>
            <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Identifiable Information from children under the age of 13.

            <h2>7. Links to External Sites</h2>
            <p>Our Service contains links to other sites that are not operated by us. If you click a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>

            <h2>8. Data Retention & Security</h2>
            <p>We retain your feedback and email address in our secure email inbox for as long as necessary to resolve your inquiry or for historical reference. We take reasonable measures to protect your data but remember that no method of transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

            <h2>9. GDPR & CCPA Rights</h2>
            <p>We respect your data rights. Under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), you have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data.</p>
