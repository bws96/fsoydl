        <div class="content">
            <p>At Flow State, accessible from <strong>https://fsoydl.pages.dev</strong>, one of our main priorities is the privacy of our visitors. This Privacy Policy document contains types of information that is collected and recorded by Flow State and how we use it.</p>
    
            <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
            <p>We do not require you to create an account to use our site. However, we may collect the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Log Files:</strong> Like many other websites, we use log files. These files merely log visitors to the site - usually a standard procedure for hosting companies and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date/time stamp, and referring/exit pages.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We use cookies to store information including visitors' preferences, and the pages on the website that the visitor accessed or visited.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Third-Party Privacy Policies</h2>
            <p>Flow State's Privacy Policy does not apply to other advertisers or websites. Thus, we are advising you to consult the respective Privacy Policies of these third-party ad servers for more detailed information.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google AdSense:</strong> Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Affiliate Disclosure</h2>
            <p>Flow State is a participant in the <strong>Amazon Services LLC Associates Program</strong>, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com. We also participate in other affiliate programs (e.g., Writesonic, InVideo).</p>
            <p>This means if you click on a link and purchase an item, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.</p>

            <h2>4. GDPR & CCPA Rights</h2>
            <p>We respect your data rights. Under the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act), you have the right to request access to, correction of, or deletion of your personal data.</p>
